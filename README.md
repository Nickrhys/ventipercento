# ventipercento

The purpose of this project is to learn how to requests to the server using Ajax. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html

The project will start with a table in the db called People, which will have a column for the person's name. Once I can input names by submitting the form, I will then do this with ajax, meaning no need to refresh the page. I will check the names have been added to the DB by outputting them on a 'show' page.
